# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The r squared coefficient equals 0.85, this value indicates a strong correlation between the age and price.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Perhaps not as accurate but it has improved based on the correlation of the prediction and the actual values 

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
The model predicts that a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth $14765.80 and predicts that a 20 yr old with 150000 miles is worth $14063

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
This would indicate that the car is not worth that much while the person driving would lose more value.
