# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value appeared as 0.6257932855322312. This suggests that the comparisons between the blood pressure and age aren't a major effecting factor despite their similarity. 

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
A 43 years old has a predicted blood pressure of 137.46185286.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think the model predictions aren't that accurate as the data seems unorganized and insufficient. Perhaps more data can give us a more accurate and reliable prediction.
